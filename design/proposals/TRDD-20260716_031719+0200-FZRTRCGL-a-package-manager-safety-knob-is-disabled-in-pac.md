# a package-manager safety knob is disabled in package-manager config: 1 gap(s)

## ⏵ STATE — READ THIS FIRST ON RESUME (authoritative; supersedes the body) — 2026-07-16

**PROPOSED BY THE JANITOR — awaiting approval. NOT authorized to execute.**

The janitor detected this in code the **USER owns**, so it may only propose. It has NOT touched
anything and will not, until a human or the main Claude approves by running:

```
/janitor-support-open-ticket TRDD-FZRTRCGL
```

That command opens a support ticket, promotes this TRDD `proposal → planned`, and the janitor's
scheduler dispatches **janitor-security-agent** to fix it at the next free heartbeat slot.

**Finding (the repo's GitHub config is off-baseline, severity `medium`):**

**PKGPOL-001** (package-manager-policy, severity `medium`)

**What:** Configuration disables a supply-chain safeguard — lockfile enforcement, integrity checking, or install-script sandboxing.

**Why it matters:** These knobs are the only thing standing between a compromised transitive dependency and arbitrary code execution at install time.

**Fix to attempt:** Restore the safeguard and re-run the install to confirm nothing depended on it being off. If something did, that dependency is the real finding.

**Found:** no .npmrc — missing supply-chain knobs (set minimum-release-age=7200, trust-policy=no-downgrade, block-exotic-subdeps=true)

**Evidence:**
- `package.json`
- `.npmrc`

## Verification

The dispatched agent is fail-safe: it fixes what is safe and FLAGS what needs a human (it never
rotates credentials, never force-pushes, never pushes to `main`). It returns one line plus a report
path, and closes the ticket with an explicit status.

## Notes and lessons learned

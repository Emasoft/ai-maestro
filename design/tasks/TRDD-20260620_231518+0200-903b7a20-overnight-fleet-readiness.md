# TRDD-903b7a20 — Overnight fleet-readiness campaign

## ⏵ STATE — READ THIS FIRST ON RESUME (authoritative; supersedes the body) — 2026-06-20

**Mandate (user, 2026-06-20 ~23:00, going to sleep, explicit autonomous authorization):**
Keep working + coordinating with the janitor-plugin Claude and MANAGER-plugin Claude
via GitHub issues. Ready the ai-maestro API + plugin fleet for the final activation
test before the governance PR. Use the memory system. Do NOT stop until: (1) all
ai-maestro functions obey the governance rules, (2) all scripts align with the
plugins' skills/needs, (3) all install procedures are secure/updated/aligned. Launch
MULTIPLE ultracode workflows to verify the TRDD implementations + all pending tasks.
Run scenario tests with dev-browser; make the UI flawless + agents
controllable/configurable per governance. Improve what needs improving. Decide from
real tests, grounded in facts. PRIORITIZE SECURITY. Notify issues to the janitor via GitHub.

**Ground truth (verified 2026-06-20 23:15):**
- Branch `governance-rules`, clean, `fork/governance-rules` in sync. HEAD `6e1eeb57`.
- Governance constitution = `docs/GOVERNANCE-RULES.md` (R1–R40, 1401 lines). **No PRRD** (this project predates the PRRD convention; GOVERNANCE-RULES.md IS the rule source).
- `design/tasks/`: 20 TRDDs (8 `status: not-started`, 1 completed, 1 superseded, 10 no-status/older-format). `design/proposals/`: 4 — ALL tier-2, ALL security/alignment. `design/archived/`: 4. (`design/requirements`, `design/refused` DO NOT EXIST — an earlier `64/64` count was a glob artifact.)
- The 4 proposals (the security spine): (a) AID PoP nonce-bound vs timestamp-window; (b) route CLI plugin/skill/local-message mutations through server API (decoupling); (c) bind sudo tokens to op+subject, authenticate-before-consume; (d) script SSOT + code-signing readiness, dedupe AMP tree, route hook through intermediary.
- Open fork issues (16): #45 decoupling CLI verbs, #44 plugin publish→CPV canonical, #43 kanban DONE, #42 core handshake blocked, #41 webdesign role conformance, #40 kanban pillar (CLI half DONE this session), #39 assistant-role plugin, #37 frozen-CLI-decoupling+memory rule, #35 MANAGER↔ai-maestro sync, #34 wire memory recall into run loop, #33 R22 self-ID, #32 plugins write state outside workdir, #27 AMP approval messages, #5/#4/#3 Haephestos.
- Server UP (`/api/sessions` → 401 = AID-auth-gated, running). 27 scenarios. `dev-browser` CLI present.

**SCOPE BOUNDARY (load-bearing):** ai-maestro (THIS repo) = fix directly. The plugin
fleet (ai-maestro-plugin, 8 role-plugins, janitor, MANAGER, CPV, …) = OTHER repos →
**file/Update GitHub issues, NEVER edit their source** (cross-project rule). Live
AID-authed kanban round-trip = agent-only (owner session gets 401) — coordinate, can't do solo.

**NEXT ACTION:** Phase A verification workflow is launching (read-only ultracode
sweep): governance-compliance (R1–R40 + gov issues), script↔skill alignment (#45/#35),
install-security, TRDD-implementation verification. Reports → `reports/overnight-verify/`.
On completion: synthesize → Phase C (ai-maestro fixes, worktree-isolated) + Phase E
(file plugin-fleet issues) + Phase D (scenario tests). Each phase commits + updates this STATE block.

**Load-bearing facts / gotchas:**
- Every GitHub write self-identifies (R22): `_Posted by the Claude developing **ai-maestro** (via the shared @Emasoft gh auth)._`
- Never `git add -A` — stage by name. Commit fixes with WHY + `TRDD-903b7a20`.
- Memory edits in MAIN context (store outside repo; subagents can't reach it).
- Workflow fix-agents: `isolation: worktree` + explicit write-scope constraint (project root + /tmp only).
- Reports → gitignored `reports/`. Service `[janitor-heartbeat]` markers between phases.

**Durable artifacts to read before acting:**
- `docs/GOVERNANCE-RULES.md` (R1–R40), `design/proposals/*.md` (the 4 security proposals).
- Memory: `project_aid_security_plan`, `governance-r26-r40-security-model`, `project-governance-rules-pr` (LOCAL), fleet hubs (USER).
- `reports/overnight-verify/` (this campaign's findings, once Phase A lands).

## Plan

- **Phase A** — read-only verification ultracode sweep (governance / scripts / installs / TRDDs) → findings reports.
- **Phase B** — synthesize: prioritized fix list (security first); split ai-maestro-fixable vs plugin-fleet.
- **Phase C** — implement ai-maestro fixes (worktree-isolated agents), each build+test verified, committed.
- **Phase D** — scenario tests via dev-browser (UI flawless + agent controllability/configurability per governance).
- **Phase E** — file/update GitHub issues for plugin-fleet items + notify the janitor.

## Progress log

- 2026-06-20T23:15 — TRDD created. Ground truth established. Launching Phase A.

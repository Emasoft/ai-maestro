# Fleet recovery — server-internal liveness detection + ensure-resume actuation across the fleet

## ⏵ STATE — READ THIS FIRST ON RESUME (authoritative) — 2026-07-16

Server-internal liveness + actuation: the server watches the whole fleet and RESUMES stalled
agents. Cross-agent reach is the SERVER's job, never a `#J` call (R42) — the `#J` side only asks
`ensure-resume <self>`. Blocked on [[DXJZM3BW]] (the `ensure-resume` verb + route) and
[[1GGQ4HWY]] (an agent stalled on token expiry is un-resumable until the cascade heals it).
**NEXT ACTION:** implement the server-internal liveness scan + actuation that reuses the existing
queue/slash substrate; no new cross-agent script surface.

## Problem / Goal

An agent can go idle mid-task (rate-limit turn-death, a stalled tool, a dropped notification) and
never resume on its own. The server must DETECT that and actuate a resume — for the WHOLE fleet,
because cross-agent liveness is inherently the server's responsibility (an agent cannot and must
not drive another, R42). This is the actuation half of `ensure-resume`.

## Scope (server-internal — reuses existing actuation, adds no cross-agent script)

- **Liveness detection:** a server-internal scan over the registered fleet using the existing
  5-state safe-state model (`lib/session-safe-state.ts`) + hook activity stream to classify each
  agent (active / idle-waiting / stalled / token-blocked).
- **Actuation:** for a stalled agent at a safe idle prompt, resume it by reusing
  `aimaestro-session.sh slash|queue` (the server owns the queue; a hibernated agent is enqueued,
  not blocked on). NO new cross-agent verb — [[DXJZM3BW]]'s `ensure-resume <self>` is the ONLY
  new surface, and it is self-scoped; the fleet-wide actuation is server-internal.
- **Token-blocked agents** are handed to [[1GGQ4HWY]]'s cascade first (resume is pointless until
  the credential heals), then resumed.

## Open issues this NPT must honor

- **ai-maestro#60** — authenticated daemon→agent command injection for freeze-recovery (signed):
  the actuation path must be the authenticated injection, not an unauth keystroke.
- **ai-maestro#51** — active idle-agent wake mechanism: this NPT is where that wake lands.

## Reuse (do not reinvent)

- Actuation substrate = the existing stop/restart safe-state poll + `session.sh queue/slash`.
- Liveness = the existing hook activity stream + `lib/session-safe-state.ts`; do NOT add a
  second polling channel (WebSocket-only per the project's no-polling rule where it applies).

## Verification

- A deliberately-stalled test agent at a safe idle prompt is detected and resumed via the
  authenticated path (#60); a token-blocked agent is healed by [[1GGQ4HWY]] first, then resumed.
- No cross-agent script surface added (only [[DXJZM3BW]]'s self-scoped `ensure-resume`).
- `tsc` clean; liveness/actuation unit tests green.

## Approval log

- 2026-07-16T20:06:24+0200 — Tier-0 self-mandate (derived NPT of [[KCRMSNL7]], server-internal
  in-scope dev; reuses existing actuation). Authored directly as `planned`.

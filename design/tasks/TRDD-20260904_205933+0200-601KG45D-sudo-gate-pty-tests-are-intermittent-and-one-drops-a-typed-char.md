# The sudo-gate pty tests are intermittent, and these are the tests that pin a security fix

## Problem

`tests/unit/maestro-sudo-gate-pty.test.ts` has failed intermittently — 4 failures in 35 runs,
and not always the same test. **Read that rate as conditional, not as the file's baseline.**
Split by whether the since-deleted P0 was present, it is **4 / 21 with** and **0 / 14
without** — but **three of those four failures are in ONE batch that also ran under
background load, so the experiment cannot separate P0 from load** (see §Evidence; no
p-value is quotable here and earlier versions of this card wrongly quoted one). The
intermittency is real and was observed; what it depends on is open, and that is step 0.
This matters more than an ordinary flake because P6, P8,
P9 and P10 in that file are the *only* behavioural pin on TRDD-WV8FDAH0's fix — the one that
stops a ^C at the password prompt leaving the terminal echo-off or putting the typed password
on screen. **An unreliable pin on a security fix is close to no pin**: a real regression would
read as "the flaky one again".

## Evidence — measured 2026-09-04, four batches

| batch | P0? | condition | failures / runs | which |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | present | pty-based P0 | 3 / 13 | P8 ×2, P9 ×1 |
| B | **absent** | that P0 `it.skip`ped | 0 / 6 | — |
| C | present | the final, non-pty P0 | 1 / 8 | P8 ×1 |
| D | **absent** | P0 fully removed | 0 / 8 | — |

**with P0: 4 / 21 · without P0: 0 / 14.**

Batch B counts as P0-ABSENT, and an earlier version of this card had it the other way round.
`it.skip` does not merely stop the assertion — **a skipped test's `beforeEach` does not run
either**, so B's runs carried no extra HTTP `listen(0)`, no `mkdtemp`, and no pty. Measured
with a throwaway probe rather than assumed: a describe with one skipped and one real test
saw the hook fire **once**, not twice; a second probe with two real tests and one skipped saw
**two**, which removes the "counter read too early" reading of the first. Correcting it moved
6 clean runs across the split — it changed the numbers, and what those numbers support is
settled further down, not here.

The order matters, because three of the four batches overturned the reading of the one
before, and two of those readings were nearly committed as fact (A was the first data and
overturned nothing):

- After **B**, I believed the extra pty allocation caused it.
- **C** appeared to refute that — the flake survived with no extra pty — so I called B's
  clean sweep small-`n` luck and the flake "pre-existing".
- **D** undercuts that in turn: C's P0 still ran `beforeEach`, so C was never a clean
  P0-free condition, and with P0 fully gone the file is 0/8.
- Re-classifying **B** as P0-absent then moved 6 clean runs across the split, producing the
  table above.
- Finally the p-values computed on that table were themselves withdrawn — see below — so the
  table is a record of what was observed, not evidence for a cause.

What every one of those readings shared was treating a clean batch of 6-8 as evidence of
absence. It is not — at any rate consistent with this data, a clean run of six is common.

**Two confounders that survive all of this.** Batch A ran while a background agent was live,
so machine load is confounded with the P0 variable in exactly the batch that carries **three
of the four** failures, so the two variables moved together and cannot be told apart. And C's
P0, though it allocated no pty, still ran `beforeEach` — an HTTP `listen(0)` plus a
`mkdtemp` — so "no extra pty" was never the same condition as "no P0".

**A limit on the skip finding**, since the split rests on it: it was measured for a *static*
`it.skip`, which is what batch B used. A runtime `ctx.skip()` inside a body runs `beforeEach`
first, and `describe.skip` and `-t` filtering are untested here. Do not generalise the
result past the form batch B actually used.

**Where that leaves it: NO p-value belongs here, and two earlier versions of this card
quoted one.** The measurement is:

> **4 failures in 35 runs. All 4 fell in P0-active batches. 3 of those 4 are in a single
> batch that also ran under background-agent load.** The experiment cannot separate P0 from
> machine load, because the two varied together.

That is the whole result, and it is a statement about the experiment's *design*, not a
finding in either direction.

**Why the p-values were deleted rather than corrected a third time.** A permutation test
asks how often chance alone would put all 4 failures in the P0-active bucket — which
presumes the runs were exchangeable, i.e. assignment was random. It was not: the batches ran
in time order, against **four different versions of the file** (pty-P0 / P0 skipped /
non-pty P0 / no P0), on a machine whose load changed between them. So the null the test
inverts never described this experiment, and both numbers this card previously carried —
`0.052`, then `0.114`, then `0.36` for the A-excluded split — were precise quantities
computed on an assumption the card itself refutes two paragraphs earlier. A p-value lends
borrowed authority; that is exactly the failure this card exists to record.

**And "exclude batch A, therefore nothing" was also unfair.** Dropping the batch that
contains 3 of the 4 events *because* it is confounded biases hard toward the null — almost
no events survive, so of course nothing is detectable. An earlier version promoted that
reading into a block quote. Both readings are defensible; neither is decisive; the design
flaw is the honest summary.

**Step 0 must therefore fix the DESIGN, not just raise `n`:** interleave or randomise the
arms within a single session on a quiet machine, rather than running one condition per batch
in time order. Without that, more runs buy more precision about nothing in particular.

## A separate gap this turned up: nothing executes the shebang

The deleted P0 asked "does the harness's bash match the scripts' `#!/usr/bin/env bash`?"
That question was **confused from the start**, and noticing why is worth more than the test
was. The pty tests run `bash -c '… source <copy>; maestro_sudo_ensure …'` — they **source**
the scripts into an already-running bash (5 such sites) and **never execute the shebang at
all**. So no test in this file ever depended on the answer.

But production *does* invoke these scripts through that shebang, and **no test exercises
that path**. A review challenged this as fabricated, on the grounds that
`aimaestro-agent-ctrl-c.test.ts` runs the agent script — so it was measured, and the gap is
real. Every invocation in the suite passes the script as an ARGUMENT to bash:

- `ptySpawn('bash', [AGENT, 'probe', …])` — aimaestro-agent-ctrl-c.test.ts:42
- `execFileSync('bash', [join(SCRIPTS, 'aimaestro-agent.sh'), …])` — cli-help-exit-contract, capabilities
- `source ${copy}` — the five gate-pty sites

**`bash <script>` does not use the shebang line either** — that is the part the challenge
missed, and it is why "a test runs the script" is not the same as "a test exercises the
shebang". Searched for a `.sh` executed with no leading interpreter across `tests/`,
`package.json` and `.github/`, covering literal paths, template literals, `shell: true`, and
`./x.sh` / `sh -c` forms: no hits. (An earlier, narrower grep matched only
identifier-shaped arguments under `tests/unit` — it supported a much weaker claim than the
one written beside it.)

It is NOT this card's job: it belongs in its own file, where an extra pty costs nothing, and
it must invoke the script as a program (`execFileSync(SCRIPT, …)`), not under `bash`.

## The clue worth chasing first

One P9 failure was **not** a timeout. The gate reached the server and POSTed a password that
was the real one **minus its final character**:

```
expected '{"password":"wrong-pw-9MZQ4T7E-x7q"}' to contain 'wrong-pw-9MZQ4T7E-x7q2'
```

The harness writes `SECRET + '\r'` in a single `p.write`, so nothing split the *write*. The
loss happened between that write and `read` consuming the line. Two hypotheses, both
UNVERIFIED — do not treat either as a finding, and do not test only the first:

1. **`stty` flushed queued input.** `stty` uses `TCSAFLUSH` on some paths, which discards
   pending input, and the gate manipulates the tty at exactly that moment (`stty -echo` on
   the handler's RETURN trap). **If this is it, it is a user-facing bug, not a test
   problem** — a human typing while the gate re-disables echo loses a character and gets an
   unexplained refusal. Against it: a flush would tend to drop a leading or middle run, not
   exactly the final byte.
2. **The line terminated one byte early.** The pty is in canonical mode, so the line
   discipline assembles the line; a `\r` arriving while `stty` is mid-transition can end it
   before the last byte lands. This fits "short by exactly the tail" better than (1) does.

Ruled out: a truncated HTTP body. The JSON parsed cleanly and only the *value* was short.
Also not `MAX_CANON` (1024 on Darwin) — the secret is 22 characters.

## Proposed fix

Investigate in this order, and do not skip to the third:

1. **Decide whether input is genuinely being lost**, by driving the gate at a pty and typing
   a known string across the stty transition, asserting on what the server received. If
   characters are lost, the defect is in the gate and this card changes shape entirely.
2. If the tty is innocent, remove the harness's dependence on wall-clock timing. The tests
   type at fixed offsets (^C at 300 ms, password at 1200 ms) after seeing the prompt, which
   assumes the caller's trap ran and the read resumed inside 900 ms. Drive on OBSERVED
   output where a marker exists (P8/P10 print `PRIOR-INT`).
3. Only P9 has no marker — `trap '' INT` prints nothing by construction — so it is the one
   case that may legitimately need a wider margin. Widen it last, and say in the test why
   that one is timing-bound when the others are not.

## Verification

- The file passes **30 consecutive runs** — but read what that does and does not buy, because
  it depends entirely on the true rate, which is the thing in dispute. The table below is
  **ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY**: each row assumes independent runs at a fixed rate, which is the same
  assumption the withdrawn p-values leaned on and which this data does not satisfy. It is
  here to show how strongly the answer depends on a rate nobody has measured cleanly — not
  to be quoted as a probability.

  | assumed rate | 30 clean runs by luck |
  |---|---|
  | 19.0% (P0-active, 4/21) | 0.2% |
  | 11.4% (pooled, 4/35) | 2.6% |
  | **4.5% (batch A excluded, 1/22)** | **24.8%** |

  So if the A-excluded picture is the true one — and §Evidence says it may well be — then
  **30 green runs prove almost nothing**, coming up clean a quarter of the time anyway. Do
  not read a 30-run sweep as closure until step 0 has fixed the rate; and do not trim the
  number without redoing this arithmetic against whatever step 0 measures.
- If step 1 finds real input loss, that becomes its own fix with its own pty test, and this
  card cites it.

## Estimated risk

LOW for the harness work. Step 1 could raise the severity sharply if input loss is real.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Step 0: re-measured the flake rate with P0 fully absent, n >= 24, settling whether the
      intermittency pre-dates P0 at all — every failure so far had some P0 present.
- [ ] Established whether the truncated password was tty input loss or a harness artifact,
      with the measurement recorded here, testing BOTH hypotheses in the clue section.
- [ ] The timing dependence removed wherever an observable marker exists.
- [ ] 30 consecutive green runs of `tests/unit/maestro-sudo-gate-pty.test.ts`.
- [ ] TRDD-WV8FDAH0's STATE block updated to drop its caveat about the pin being intermittent.

# Build & Test Report — 2026-03-16

## Summary

All 4 steps completed successfully.

| Step | Command | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1. TSC | `npx tsc --noEmit` | PASS — 0 errors |
| 2. Tests | `yarn test` | PASS — 897 tests, 31 files, 0 failures (5.71s) |
| 3. Build | `yarn build` | PASS — production bundle built (20.10s) |
| 4. PM2 Restart | `pm2 restart ai-maestro` | PASS — PID 59030, status online, v0.26.0 |

## Step 1: TypeScript Type Check

```
npx tsc --noEmit
```

No output — clean pass with zero type errors.

## Step 2: Unit Tests (vitest)

```
Test Files  31 passed (31)
     Tests  897 passed (897)
  Start at  02:38:52
  Duration  4.91s (transform 2.29s, setup 0ms, import 3.28s, tests 8.83s, environment 2ms)

Done in 5.71s.
```

All 897 tests across 31 test files passed. Some stderr output from expected error-path tests (e.g., agents-core-service hibernate/startup error handling) — these are intentional and represent tested error scenarios.

## Step 3: Production Build

```
yarn build
Done in 20.10s.
```

Build completed successfully. All pages (static and dynamic) compiled without errors. First Load JS shared: 88.2 kB.

## Step 4: PM2 Restart

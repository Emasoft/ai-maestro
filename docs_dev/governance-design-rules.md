## Overview

AI Maestro implements a team governance model with seven titles (MANAGER, CHIEF-OF-STAFF, ORCHESTRATOR, ARCHITECT, INTEGRATOR, MEMBER, AUTONOMOUS), teams (isolated messaging + ACL), and groups (lightweight broadcast collections). Teams require a MANAGER to function. Groups are unstructured agent collections with no governance.

---

## R1. Teams and Groups (v2.0)

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R1.1 | **Teams** have isolated messaging, ACL, governance titles, and a COS. Former "closed teams" | Explicit |
| R1.2 | **Groups** are lightweight agent collections for broadcast messaging. No governance, no COS, no kanban. Former "open teams" | Explicit |
| R1.3 | Every team **SHOULD** have a COS assigned — the COS manages membership and external communication | Explicit |
| R1.4 | Teams require a **MANAGER** to exist on the host before they can be created | Explicit (v2.0) |
| R1.5 | Teams without a MANAGER are **blocked** (`team.blocked = true`) — all operations frozen | Explicit (v2.0) |
| R1.6 | Groups have no governance constraints — any agent can subscribe/unsubscribe freely | Explicit |

**Rationale:** The COS is the team's operational leader. The MANAGER is the host-wide governance authority. Without either, the team cannot function safely. Groups exist for lightweight coordination without governance overhead.

## R2. Team Name Rules

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R2.1 | Team names must be unique (case-insensitive comparison) — no two teams can share the same name | Explicit |
| R2.2 | Duplicate name check must be enforced both server-side (API rejects with 409) and client-side (UI shows inline error before POST) | Implicit (both creation surfaces exist) |
| R2.3 | Renaming a team via update must also check uniqueness against all other teams (excluding the team being renamed) | Implicit (rename is an update operation) |

---

## R3. Role Hierarchy Rules

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R3.1 | Seven governance titles exist: **MANAGER** (global singleton), **CHIEF-OF-STAFF** (per team), **ORCHESTRATOR** (per team), **ARCHITECT**, **INTEGRATOR**, **MEMBER** (default team title), **AUTONOMOUS** (no team) | Explicit (v2.0) |
| R3.2 | Only ONE agent can be MANAGER at any given time (singleton constraint) | Explicit |
| R3.3 | COS is a per-team title — each team has exactly one COS | Explicit |
| R3.4 | An agent can be COS of only **ONE** team at any time | Explicit (corrected 2026-03-26) |
| R3.5 | All role changes (assign/remove MANAGER, assign/remove COS) require the governance password | Explicit |
| R3.6 | MANAGER has full authority over all teams: can add/remove agents, assign COS, approve transfers, create/delete teams, message anyone | Explicit |
| R3.7 | COS is responsible for **external communication** of their team — they are the contact point for outside agents | Explicit |
| R3.8 | COS decides the **staff composition** (add/remove agents) of their team — this is why they are called "chief-of-staff" | Explicit |
| R3.9 | MANAGER can do everything COS can, but **usually delegates** to the COS | Explicit |
| R3.10 | Typical workflow: MANAGER creates a team, assigns a COS, and lets the COS manage the team from there | Explicit |
| R3.11 | Reassigning MANAGER to a new agent immediately revokes the role from the old agent (only one MANAGER exists) | Implicit (singleton) |
| R3.12 | COS changes (assign/remove) on a team must **NOT** be possible via the generic `PUT /api/teams/[id]` endpoint — only via the dedicated `POST /api/teams/[id]/chief-of-staff` endpoint which requires the governance password | Implicit (prevents bypass of password protection) |

---

## R4. Agent Membership Rules

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R4.1 | Non-MANAGER agents can be in at most **ONE team** at any given time (single-team membership) | Explicit (v2.0) |
| R4.2 | Any agent can subscribe to **unlimited groups** simultaneously (groups have no governance) | Explicit (v2.0) |
| R4.3 | **MANAGER** is not in any team — MANAGER operates at the host level | Explicit (v2.0) |
| R4.4 | When an agent joins a team, it is auto-assigned the **MEMBER** title and the programmer plugin | Explicit (v2.0) |
| R4.5 | An agent cannot be added to a team they are already a member of (no duplicate membership in `agentIds`) | Explicit |
| R4.6 | COS **must** be a member of the team they lead (present in `agentIds[]`) — they manage the team staff and the message filter relies on `agentIds` for same-team communication | Implicit (logical necessity) |
| R4.7 | Removing a COS from a team's `agentIds` while they remain `chiefOfStaffId` is **forbidden** — COS title can only be removed by deleting the team | Implicit (COS immutability invariant) |
| R4.8 | The UI must **always show team memberships** when selecting agents for any operation (add to team, remove from team, transfer, team creation agent selection) | Explicit |
| R4.9 | Agent existence must be validated when adding to a team — `agentIds` must reference agents that actually exist in the registry | Implicit (referential integrity) |

---

## R5. Transfer Rules

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R5.1 | Moving a normal agent **FROM** a team requires a transfer request (approval workflow) — the agent cannot simply leave | Explicit (implemented) |
| R5.2 | Only MANAGER or COS can **create** transfer requests | Explicit (enforced) |
| R5.3 | Only the source team's COS or MANAGER can **approve/reject** transfers | Explicit (enforced) |
| R5.4 | COS **cannot be transferred out** of their own team — COS title is immutable to team lifecycle | Implicit (COS immutability invariant) |
| R5.5 | **Destination team must exist** at the time the transfer request is created | Implicit (referential integrity) |
| R5.6 | Source and destination teams must be **different** (no self-transfer) | Implicit (nonsensical operation) |
| R5.7 | On transfer approval, the **single-team constraint** (R4.1) must be checked: verify the agent is not already in another team | Implicit (logical consequence) |
| R5.8 | Duplicate pending transfer requests (same agent + same source + same destination) must be prevented | Explicit (enforced) |

---

## R6. Messaging Rules (Communication Graph, v2.0)

All teams are closed. Messaging between agents is governed by a title-based directed communication graph. Missing connections are forbidden.

**Adjacency matrix** (Y = allowed, empty = forbidden):

| Sender \ Recipient | MANAGER | COS | ORCHESTRATOR | ARCHITECT | INTEGRATOR | MEMBER | AUTONOMOUS |
|---------------------|:-------:|:---:|:------------:|:---------:|:----------:|:------:|:----------:|
| **MANAGER**         |    Y    |  Y  |      Y       |     Y     |     Y      |   Y    |     Y      |
| **CHIEF-OF-STAFF**  |    Y    |  Y  |      Y       |     Y     |     Y      |   Y    |     Y      |
| **ORCHESTRATOR**    |         |  Y  |              |     Y     |     Y      |   Y    |            |
| **ARCHITECT**       |         |  Y  |      Y       |           |            |        |            |
| **INTEGRATOR**      |         |  Y  |      Y       |           |            |        |            |
| **MEMBER**          |         |  Y  |      Y       |           |            |        |            |
| **AUTONOMOUS**      |    Y    |  Y  |              |           |            |        |     Y      |

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R6.1 | Communication rules are defined by the directed graph above — each (sender, recipient) pair must be explicitly listed | Explicit |
| R6.2 | **MANAGER** and **COS** can message all titles (full graph access) | Explicit |
| R6.3 | **ORCHESTRATOR** can message COS, ARCHITECT, INTEGRATOR, MEMBER (not MANAGER or AUTONOMOUS) | Explicit |
| R6.4 | **ARCHITECT**, **INTEGRATOR**, **MEMBER** can only message COS and ORCHESTRATOR | Explicit |
| R6.5 | **AUTONOMOUS** can message MANAGER, COS, and other AUTONOMOUS agents | Explicit |
| R6.6 | The **user** is exempt from the graph — can message any agent and receive responses from all | Explicit |
| R6.7 | When a message is blocked, the error must include a **routing suggestion** (e.g., "INTEGRATOR cannot message MANAGER. Route through CHIEF-OF-STAFF instead.") | Explicit |
| R6.8 | **Three layers of enforcement**: (1) API server validates sender/recipient titles before delivery, (2) Role-plugin main-agent .md files list allowed recipients, (3) Sub-agents are forbidden from using AMP messaging entirely | Explicit |
| R6.9 | Sub-agents have no AMP identity and cannot authenticate — they communicate only with their spawning main-agent | Explicit |

## R7. UI Robustness Rules

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R7.1 | **Prevent accidental multiple operations** from fast repeated clicks — all mutating buttons must have `submitting` guards | Explicit |
| R7.2 | Show **loading spinners** for all async operations (API calls, data fetching) | Explicit |
| R7.3 | Show **error messages** for all failures — no silent failures allowed | Explicit |
| R7.4 | Handle all **edge cases** and possible errors gracefully | Explicit |
| R7.5 | No **infinite loops** or **blocking operations** in the UI | Explicit |
| R7.6 | Show **role badges** (MANAGER: amber/gold, COS: indigo) next to agent names throughout the UI | Implicit |
| R7.7 | Show **blocked badge** on teams when no MANAGER exists | Implicit (v2.0) |
| R7.8 | **Resolve COS UUID** to human-readable agent name everywhere it is displayed — never show raw UUIDs to users | Implicit (UX requirement) |
| R7.9 | When governance data is loading, show **loading state** — do not show stale/default "normal" role which would be misleading | Implicit |

---

## R8. Data Integrity Rules

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R8.1 | All write operations on teams use **file locking** (`withLock`) to prevent corruption from concurrent writes | Implemented |
| R8.2 | `chiefOfStaffId` and `type` changes must **NOT** be accepted in the generic team update (`PUT /api/teams/[id]`) — must use dedicated password-protected endpoints | Implicit (prevents governance bypass) |
| R8.3 | Team deletion should **clean up related transfers** (cancel pending transfer requests involving the deleted team) | Implicit (referential integrity) |
| R8.4 | `Agent.team` free-text field is **display-only** — it is NOT connected to `Team.id` in the governance system, membership is tracked solely via `Team.agentIds[]` | Documented |

---

## Invariants (Must Never Be Violated)

These are hard invariants that the system must maintain at all times:

1. **COS-membership invariant**: `team.chiefOfStaffId === agentId` implies `team.agentIds.includes(agentId)`
2. **Singleton-MANAGER invariant**: At most one agent has `managerId === agentId` globally
3. **Single-team invariant**: A non-MANAGER agent appears in `agentIds` of at most one team
4. **Name-uniqueness invariant**: No two teams have the same name (case-insensitive)
5. **COS-immutability invariant**: COS title can only be removed by deleting the team (not by title reassignment)
6. **Manager-team invariant**: Teams cannot exist in an active (non-blocked) state without a MANAGER on the host
7. **Team-agent-lifecycle invariant**: Team agents cannot be woken while teams are blocked (no MANAGER)
8. **Title-plugin invariant**: Every titled agent (non-AUTONOMOUS) has exactly one role-plugin installed matching their title

## Role-Based Permission Matrix

| Action | MEMBER | COS (own team) | ORCHESTRATOR | ARCHITECT / INTEGRATOR | MANAGER | AUTONOMOUS |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------------|----------------------|---------|------------|
| Join team | Via MANAGER/COS | Via MANAGER | Via MANAGER/COS | Via MANAGER/COS | N/A (host-level) | Via MANAGER/COS |
| Leave team | No (transfer) | No (COS locked) | No (transfer) | No (transfer) | N/A | No (transfer) |
| Add agent to own team | No | Yes | No | No | Yes | No |
| Remove agent from own team | No | Yes | No | No | Yes | No |
| Assign COS | No | No | No | No | Yes (password) | No |
| Create team | No | No | No | No | Yes (password) | No |
| Delete team | No | No | No | No | Yes (password) | No |
| Create transfer request | No | Yes (own team) | No | No | Yes | No |
| Approve/reject transfer | No | Yes (own team) | No | No | Yes | No |
| Wake agent | No | Own team only | No | No | Any agent | No |
| Hibernate agent | No | Own team only | No | No | Any agent | No |
| Message (see R6 graph) | COS + ORCH | All titles | COS+ARCH+INTEG+MEM | COS + ORCH | All titles | MGR+COS+AUTO |
| Wake agent | No | Yes (own team) | No | Yes |
| Hibernate agent | No | Yes (own team) | No | Yes |
| Create team | No | No | No | Yes (password) |

## R9. Manager Requirement (v2.0)

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R9.1 | A MANAGER agent **MUST** exist on the host before any team can be created | Explicit |
| R9.2 | If no MANAGER exists, all existing teams are **blocked** (`team.blocked = true`) | Explicit |
| R9.3 | When teams are blocked, no agents can be added to or removed from them | Explicit |
| R9.4 | When teams are blocked, all agents belonging to those teams are **forcefully hibernated** (tmux sessions killed) | Explicit |
| R9.5 | AUTONOMOUS agents (not in any team) are **unaffected** by team blocking — they can remain active | Explicit |
| R9.6 | When a MANAGER is assigned (title change), all teams are **unblocked** (`team.blocked = false`) | Explicit |
| R9.7 | Unblocking does **NOT** auto-wake agents — agents remain hibernated until manually woken by the user or the MANAGER | Explicit |
| R9.8 | If a MANAGER is deleted or their title is removed, the blocking cascade triggers immediately (same as startup without MANAGER) | Explicit |
| R9.9 | At server startup, if no MANAGER is detected, team blocking + agent hibernation runs as a startup task | Explicit |

**Rationale:** Without a MANAGER, no governance authority exists to oversee teams. Blocking prevents unsupervised team operations and ensures the system is in a safe state until governance is restored.

---

## R10. Agent Lifecycle Governance (v2.0)

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R10.1 | Only the **user** (web UI, no auth headers) or the **MANAGER** agent can wake ANY agent | Explicit |
| R10.2 | Only the **user** or the **MANAGER** agent can hibernate ANY agent | Explicit |
| R10.3 | The **CHIEF-OF-STAFF** can wake or hibernate agents that belong to **their own team only** | Explicit |
| R10.4 | All other agents (MEMBER, ORCHESTRATOR, ARCHITECT, INTEGRATOR, AUTONOMOUS) **cannot** wake or hibernate any agent | Explicit |
| R10.5 | Team agents cannot be woken if no MANAGER exists on the host (even by the user — assign MANAGER first) | Explicit |
| R10.6 | The restart endpoint follows the same governance rules as the wake endpoint | Explicit |

**Enforcement points:**
- `POST /api/agents/[id]/wake` — checks auth headers, validates caller is user/MANAGER/COS-of-team
- `POST /api/agents/[id]/hibernate` — same checks
- `POST /api/sessions/[id]/restart` — checks if target agent is in a team without MANAGER

---

## R11. Title-Plugin Binding (v2.0)

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R11.1 | Every governance title (including MEMBER) has a corresponding default role-plugin | Explicit |
| R11.2 | MEMBER title installs `ai-maestro-programmer-agent` via ChangeTitle pipeline | Explicit |
| R11.3 | AUTONOMOUS title installs no role-plugin (plugin is uninstalled) | Explicit |
| R11.4 | When an agent joins a team, ChangeTeam calls ChangeTitle('member') which auto-installs the programmer plugin | Explicit |
| R11.5 | When an agent leaves a team, ChangeTeam calls ChangeTitle('autonomous') which removes the role-plugin | Explicit |
| R11.6 | The N:1 compatibility model allows multiple plugins to serve one title — the UI shows a dropdown when 2+ plugins are compatible | Explicit |

**Title → Default Plugin mapping:**

| Title | Default Role-Plugin |
|-------|-------------------|
| MANAGER | ai-maestro-assistant-manager-agent |
| CHIEF-OF-STAFF | ai-maestro-chief-of-staff |
| ORCHESTRATOR | ai-maestro-orchestrator-agent |
| ARCHITECT | ai-maestro-architect-agent |
| INTEGRATOR | ai-maestro-integrator-agent |
| MEMBER | ai-maestro-programmer-agent |
| AUTONOMOUS | (none) |

---

## R12. Minimum Team Composition (CRITICAL)

| ID | Rule | Source |
|----|------|--------|
| R12.1 | Every team **MUST** contain a minimum of 5 agents with these titles: **1 CHIEF-OF-STAFF**, **1 ARCHITECT**, **1 ORCHESTRATOR**, **1 INTEGRATOR**, **1 MEMBER** (programmer role-plugin) | Explicit |
| R12.2 | A team lacking any of the 5 required titles is a **NON-FUNCTIONAL TEAM** — the CHIEF-OF-STAFF must immediately add the missing agents | Explicit |
| R12.3 | Each role-plugin is designed for **one role only** — an agent cannot simultaneously serve as COS and ARCHITECT, or any other title combination | Explicit |
| R12.4 | Additional agents with the **MEMBER** title can be added at the judgment of the CHIEF-OF-STAFF, using the programmer role-plugin or any role-plugin compatible with the MEMBER title | Explicit |
| R12.5 | The CHIEF-OF-STAFF decides team composition based on the **design requirements document** received from the MANAGER | Explicit |
| R12.6 | The **MANAGER** must enforce R12.1 when creating teams — a team creation task must always produce at least 5 agents | Explicit |

**Example of a well-composed team (10 agents):**

| # | Title | Role-Plugin | Purpose |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | CHIEF-OF-STAFF | ai-maestro-chief-of-staff | Team operations, staffing, external comms |
| 2 | ARCHITECT | ai-maestro-architect-agent | System design, data models, architecture |
| 3 | ORCHESTRATOR | ai-maestro-orchestrator-agent | Task coordination, workflow management |
| 4 | INTEGRATOR | ai-maestro-integrator-agent | Integration, CI/CD, deployment |
| 5 | MEMBER | ai-maestro-programmer-agent | Core implementation |
| 6 | MEMBER | database-expert (custom) | Database design and optimization |
| 7 | MEMBER | react-native-programmer (custom) | Mobile frontend |
| 8 | MEMBER | figma-designer (custom) | UI/UX design |
| 9 | MEMBER | ai-ocr-expert (custom) | OCR/ML features |
| 10 | MEMBER | ios-debug-expert (custom) | Platform-specific debugging |

**Rationale:** Each title has a unique role-plugin providing specialized skills, guidance, and constraints. A team missing any core title cannot function because no other agent has the skills to fill that gap. The MEMBER title is the only one that supports multiple agents with different specializations, allowing teams to scale horizontally for implementation capacity.

---

## Updated Invariants (v2.0)

Added to the existing invariant list:

6. **Manager-team invariant**: Teams cannot exist in an active (non-blocked) state without a MANAGER on the host
7. **Team-agent-lifecycle invariant**: Team agents cannot be woken while teams are blocked (no MANAGER)
8. **Title-plugin invariant**: Every titled agent (non-AUTONOMOUS) has exactly one role-plugin installed matching their title
9. **Minimum-composition invariant**: Every team must have at least 5 agents covering all 5 required titles (COS, ARCHITECT, ORCHESTRATOR, INTEGRATOR, MEMBER)

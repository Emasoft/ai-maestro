/**
 * File Lock — in-process mutex for serializing load→modify→save operations

 * Prevents concurrent read-modify-write races within a single Node.js process.
 * Each registry file gets its own named lock. When one API request is mid-write,
 * other requests for the same file queue up and run sequentially.
 *
 * This is sufficient for Phase 1 (single Next.js process, localhost).
 * For multi-process deployments, replace with advisory file locks (e.g., proper-lockfile).

 * Violating this order will cause deadlock.

 * 1b. Unresolved recipient (alias, not UUID) from closed-team sender: denied (prevents bypass)
 * 2. Neither in a closed team: allowed (open world, current behavior) (R6.4)
 * 3. Sender is MANAGER: always allowed (R6.3)
 * 4. Sender is COS of any closed team: can reach MANAGER, other COS, own team members (R6.2)
 * 5. Normal closed-team member: can reach same-team members and own COS (R6.1)
 * 6. Outside sender to closed-team recipient: denied (R6.5) — always reached after Steps 2–5
 *
 * IMPORTANT (R6.7): Uses getClosedTeamsForAgent (plural) to correctly handle
 * COS agents who belong to multiple closed teams simultaneously.
